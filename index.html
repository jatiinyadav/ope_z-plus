            screens. Gaming consoles are truly pushing the limits of consumer entertainment technology.

            Cloud-based gaming platforms, like Google Stadia, are making the whole gaming experience seamless and easy

            Nintendo or Playstation. Rather, they’re more focused on competing with the ultra-fast cloud platforms being
